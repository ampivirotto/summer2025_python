# Introduction to Python

Introduction to Python workshop for Summer 2025

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language used widely for data analysis, web development, machine learning, and more.  In this workshop, we’ll explore the basics of Python programming by analyzing the [Palmer Penguin dataset](https://github.com/mcnakhaee/palmerpenguins) – ecological data about a cohort of penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. We’ll work with both numerical and textual data, learning how to clean, organize, analyze, and visualize information using Python. Time permitting, we’ll end with a brief introduction to machine learning using the Palmer Penguin dataset. 

## About the dataset

[Palmer Penguin Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

We'll be exploring the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://github.com/mcnakhaee/palmerpenguins?tab=readme-ov-file), a widely used dataset in data science education that provides a rich and approachable alternative to the classic iris dataset. Compiled by Dr. Allison Horst using data originally collected by researchers at the [Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/) site in Antarctica, this dataset contains biometric and categorical information about three penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago.

The dataset includes physical measurements such as bill length, flipper length, body mass, and sex, along with location data (island and region) and species identification. It's an excellent way to learn about data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning using real ecological observations.

We encourage you to read more about the dataset’s origins and purpose in [Allison Horst’s repository](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins), which includes details about data sources, citations, and motivations.
